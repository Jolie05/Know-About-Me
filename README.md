# my-summer-in-markdown
Hi! I'm Jolie Liang! I'm a 10th grader at Chatsworth Charter Highschool. I have a family of 6, with 4 daughters in total. My favorite show is Avatar the Last Airbender because of how me and my family would watch it together as a family bonding time. I also really do love Apothecary Dairies. My favorite pastime is to sleep or scroll on my phone to be honest. My favorite food is rice. My favorite color is blue or to be more precise, navy blue. My favorite animals are sea turtles and sea otters coming in at a close second. My favorite sport is soccer. I love to build Legos and maybe a few “3D wood puzzles”.

I also enjoy going camping with my family, I crochet a bit, and I also would love to paint more when I have the time. I’m trying to make time and space for sewing projects. I also really really love food (which is why my favorite food is so broad). I do love mango and peaches. I love Pompompurin, the Sanrio characters. And I love my music. I just got a record player this summer and my collection is slowly growing. I love R&B, jazz, pop, indies, and a little hiphop and kpop. My idol is Laufey (I absolutely love her). I really like to listen to Tyler the Creator, SZA, Wave to Earth, Daniel Caesar, Beabadoobee, a little of Frank Ocean, Kali Uchis, CAS, Clairo, Kendrick Lamar, and some kpop groups.

My summer vacation was really quiet and fun. I basically spent my whole summer at home. I don’t mind spending so long at my house but it’s the best time for me to relax from a year full of human interaction. But I will try to get out of the house more, like running and walking to the park more often. Most of the time I was doing my summer school. My last few summer weeks were much more fun. I had a soccer tournament for about a week, the week before I had visited my sister at her college. Then the week after I was doing my drivers ed. Some goals I have for this school year is to pass all my classes and all my AP classes.<br/>
